In this case, it is quite simple and we can define it by inspection (as $x=0$). However, this is a great opportunity to understand a little about how optimization works. If we assume that we do not know the solution, but instead we only have access to our function, and our first guess for the optimimum was $x=8$, how could we proceed?

In fact, there are many sampling-based methods that can be appropriate depending on the problem form and complexity. But these methods will almost always be slower than using a method related to the derivative as we've shown above. In this case we don't know how big of a step in the direction of $-\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}$ that we should take, and using $0.1$ was fairly arbitrary.

    "The problem with this solution is that it is not physically meaningful. In the example above, we seeded or started our optimization with random values for $v_{i+1}$ and $F_i$ and let it optimize with no constraint. However, in a controls problem, we do not get to set the initial velocity $v_i$, and our velocity in the cost function (which is v at the next time step $v_{i+1}$) depends on both $v_i$ and $F_i$ since we cannot change velocity instantanously. To account for this constraint, we can substitute the constraint back into the cost function for $v_{i+1}$ (essentially removing our equality constraint and forcing our cost to only be a function of $F_i$ now, since $v_i$ is a given): \n",

This problem is still quadratic, but has some constant terms related to $v_i$ now. This shifts where the functions is centered, but the solution is still at the bottom of the \"bowl\". See below. "
