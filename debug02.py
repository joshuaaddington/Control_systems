# a is a 1D array with 3 elements, b is a 2D array with 2 rows and 1 column.
# the result is a 2d array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
# this happened because of broadcasting. numpy tries to match the sizes of the arrays and effective turns a into an array: ([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
# it turns b into: ([1,1,1],[2,2,2]) then adds them.
